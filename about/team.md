The Nimbus client suite is built and maintained by a passionate and driven team of technologists from around the world. 

Development work is divided into subgroups, each focusing on one of the three client implementations. Skillsets and requirements often overlap, meaning that some members take on responsibilities across the subgroups. Additionally, several team members are core contributors to Nim, the programming language in which Nimbus clients are written.

The three subgroups include Nimbus Consensus, Nimbus Execution, and Nimbus Portal. Team members include development leads, supporting developers, research officers and engineers, and data scientists.

Nimbus is looking to expand the above structure and currently has multiple openings for core contributors. As an open-source public goods project Nimbus also welcomes community contributions.
