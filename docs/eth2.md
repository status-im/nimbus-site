Depending on your objective, there are various ways to run Nimbus' [consensus layer client](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2).

The reference documentation is [the Nimbus Book](https://nimbus.guide): it explains all the ways in which you can play with Nimbus, and use Nimbus to either monitor the beacon chain or become a fully-fledged validator.

We encourage you to check it out.
