In addition to our [execution layer](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth1) and [consensus layer](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2) clients we have developed several high-quality libraries (the product of our ethereum work in Nim). These include:

- Nim libp2p: https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p

- Nim BLS Curve: https://github.com/status-im/nim-blscurve

- Nim Waku -  Waku is a fork of the original Whisper protocol that enables better usability for resource restricted devices: https://github.com/status-im/nim-waku

- Nim QUIC - QUIC is being adopted as the underlying protocol for HTTP/3 and has the potential to give us censorship resistance due to its resistance to deep packet inspection: https://github.com/status-im/nim-quic

- Cryptographic functions: https://github.com/cheatfate/nimcrypto

- Nim Chronicles - detailed logging for Nim: https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronicles

- Nim Chronos - async Nim: https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos

- Nim Web3 - https://github.com/status-im/nim-web3

- Ethereum Smart Contracts in Nim:  https://github.com/status-im/nim-eth-contracts

- Nim JSON-RPC - a library for routing JSON 2.0 format remote procedure calls over different transports: https://github.com/status-im/nim-json-rpc

- Nim Stint - a stack based arbitrary precision library: https://github.com/status-im/nim-stint

- Nim Libbacktrace: https://github.com/status-im/nim-libbacktrace

- Nim EthHash - proof of work algorithm from Ethereum 1.0 reimplemented in Nim: https://github.com/status-im/nim-ethash

- Nim Eth - Ethereum-related utilities written in Nim: https://github.com/status-im/nim-eth

- Documentation Generator - language agnostic (but Nim-preconfigured) generator for beautiful detailed documentation suites for sets of libraries: https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-docs-suite

- Nim presto - an efficient library for REST API implementation: https://github.com/status-im/nim-presto


We hope you take the time to check them out :)
