### Disputes

In these terms, “dispute” has the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claim you make against or controversy you may have in relation to these Website Terms of Use, the Website, the content on the Website or your use of the Website

We prefer arbitration over litigation as we believe it meets our principle of resolving disputes in the most effective and cost-effective manner. You are bound by the following arbitration clause, which waives your right to litigation and to be heard by a judge. Please note that court review of an arbitration award is limited. You also waive all your rights to a jury trial (if any) in any and all jurisdictions.

If a (potential) dispute arises, you must first use your reasonable efforts to resolve it amicably with us. If these efforts do not result in a resolution of such dispute, you shall then send us a written notice of dispute setting out (i) the nature of the dispute and the claim you are making; and (ii) the remedy you are seeking.

If we and you are unable to further resolve this dispute within sixty (60) calendar days of us receiving this notice of dispute, then any such dispute will be referred to and finally resolved by you and us through an arbitration administered by the Swiss Chambers’ Arbitration Institution in accordance with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated herein by reference. The arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The arbitration will be held in Zug, Switzerland, and may be conducted via video conference virtual/online methods if possible. The tribunal will consist of one arbitrator, and all proceedings as well as communications between the parties will be kept confidential. The language of the arbitration will be in English. Payment of all relevant fees in respect of the arbitration, including filing, administration and arbitrator fees, will be in accordance with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration.

Regardless of any applicable statute of limitations, you must bring any claims within one year after the claim arose or the time when you should have reasonably known about the claim. You also waive the right to participate in a class action lawsuit or a classwide arbitration against us.
