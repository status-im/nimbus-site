      title: 'Resilient',
      description:
        "Nimbus includes several features to improve redundancy and resilience. For example, distributed keystore support allows for pairing a single Nimbus instance with multiple Web3Signer servers. If one of the instances fails, another takes over. Plus, Nimbus can support multiple Beacon Nodes, creating redundancy and resilience against downtime.",
