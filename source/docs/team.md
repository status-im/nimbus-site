In addition to a dedicated Nimbus team, Status as an organization will support development through our expertise in smart contracts, Ethereum and mobile development, and marketing and user experience research.

### [Eugene Kabanov](https://github.com/cheatfate)

Eugene has deep background and interest in systems programming, reverse engineering, development of high-load and high-performance networking services, and information security. He joined Nim community 3 years ago and has contributed to Nim networking, threading, and multiprocessing.

### [Jacek Sieka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sieka/)

With a keen interest and background in peer-to-peer applications and compilers, Jacek joined Status as Head of Research, coming most recently from the high-frequency trading world. Fun hobby projects from the past include DC++ (a file sharing app), nlvm (an llvm-based Nim compiler) and more!

### [Mamy Ratsimbazafy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mamyratsimbazafy)

Mamy joined Status as a Nim developer in the research team. After a career in leading American and French banks and non-profits, he decided that tech, blockchain and AI will eat the world. On the side, instead of mining he is teaching deep learning tricks to his GPU.

### [Yuriy Glukhov](https://github.com/yglukhov)

Yuriy has deep passion for new technologies and keen interest in many areas of IT. He was one of the first CTOs to successfully use Nim in a commercial project.


### [Zahary Karadjov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zahary/)

Zahary is member of the core compiler team of the Nim programming language. He joined the project 5 years ago, hoping that one day Nim will surpass C++ in usage and popularity. His career started as a game engine developer, where he learned how to push the modern hardware to its limits, but eventually he went on to become the CTO of a company shipping an IoT device, a SaaS platform for web publishers and even a defunct Chromium fork.

### [Dustin Brody](https://github.com/tersec)

Dustin is the team's Pure Quickwitted Indianglassfish.


### [Ștefan Talpalaru](https://github.com/stefantalpalaru)

Ștefan comes from a decade of professional web development and a decade and a half of amateur free software contributions in a wide range of domains and programming languages. His claim to fame in the Nim world is the grafting of a Go runtime to the Nim compiler by way of the pluggable garbage collector API.
